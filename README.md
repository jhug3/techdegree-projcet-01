# Techdegree Project 01
# League builder project
# I am attempting to achive the extra credit porition of the grade.
# This project uses a csv file of data to create a new file with team names for a soccer league.
# 	Main output: teams.txt
#	Each team is listed as a title, then listed on a seperate line is: players name, (YES/No) for soccer experience, and guardians name.
# The project alos generates 18 files using each players name as a file name. example john_hughes.txt 
#	This file is a short letter announcing what team the player is on and when practice starts, addressed to each players guardian.
# The program does have some feedback for the user along with some error checking.
